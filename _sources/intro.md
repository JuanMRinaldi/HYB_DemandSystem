# Welcome to our replication of Koijen & Yogo (2019)
This project, a replication exercise based on Koijen & Yogo (2019), aims to delve deeper into the demand system asset pricing approach and its potential applications. Authored by Martin Rinaldi and Spencer Dean, and submitted to Prof. Alberto Mokak Teguia, this book implements two simple examples that summarize the main findings of the paper while also motivating our proposal for an extension.
